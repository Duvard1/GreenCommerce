# 🗑️ DeleteUser Microservice

This microservice is part of the **GreenCommerce** ecosystem, a distributed e-commerce platform for selling lightweight construction materials. The purpose of `DeleteUser` is to allow an authenticated user to delete their own account from the system using their JWT token.

---

## ⚙️ Functionality

This microservice exposes a DELETE /delete-user endpoint. When accessed by an **authenticated** user (via JWT token), it removes the corresponding user from the MySQL database based on their **email**, which is extracted from the token.
The token must include the user's email or sub claim. Access is protected using JWT (HS256), and the secret must be stored as an environment variable (JWT_SECRET).

### 🚀 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.11
- ⚡ FastAPI
- 🐬 MySQL (RDS AWS)
- 🐳 Docker
- 🔒 JWT

---

## 🛠️ Software Architecture

This microservice follows a RESTful architecture combined with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

- `models/:` Contains logic for connecting and operating on the MySQL database
- `views/:` Defines the route exposed by the API
- `controllers/:` Coordinates the request handling and deletion logic
- `utils.py:` Contains token decoding and logging utilities

The architecture is designed using KISS and YAGNI principles: it is simple, concise, and avoids unnecessary complexity.

## 🧼​ Design pattern - YAGNI
“Don’t implement functionalities until you actually need them.”

- Does not implement advanced validations or session control that are unnecessary for its purpose: deleting a user.
- Does not include logic to search for users, update data, or handle multiple roles, because its only responsibility is to delete the authenticated user.
- Avoids unnecessary infrastructure such as external services, event queues, or separate repositories, as they are not justified for a simple operation.
- Does not include multiple layers (like DAO, Service Layer, etc.), because direct logic is sufficient and clearer.
